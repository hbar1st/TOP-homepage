# TOP-homepage

This is a HTML/CSS responsive home page created for The Odin Project. It has 3 different layouts to suit desktop/mobile and tablet (portrait layouts).

I'd like this design to also work on landscape mode for the tablet.

The home page will feature 3 main areas. The About Me area at the top, the My Work area with links to prior projects that I created and finally a Contact Me area at the end.
